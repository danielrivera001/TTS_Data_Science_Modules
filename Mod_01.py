#1.Accept the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them
print("Rivera, Daniel")
#prints my name with a space
#2.Accept an integer (n) input from the user and compute the value of n+nn+nnn. For example if n=4 then n + nn + nnn = 4 + 44 + 444 = 492
#3.Ask the user "What country are you from?" then print the following statement: "I have heard that [input] is a beautiful country!"
print("What Country are you from?")
#prints the question
print("I have heard that Puerto Rico is a beautiful country!")
#prints the answer
n = 7
#designates the number 7 to "n"
z = n + (n * n) + (n * n * n)
#define a new variable z that is the summation of the products of n
print("z =",z)
#What is the output of the following Python code?
x = 10
#designates x as 10
y = 50
#designates y as 50
if (x ** 2 > 100 and y < 100):
    #if-and statement involving x and y
   print(x, y)
#Since x*2 is 20, and 20 is not greater than 10 AND y is 50 and it's less than 100, nothing is printed becuase only 1/2 requirements are satisfied!

#What is the output of the following addition (+) operator, and why does this code chunk execute this way?
a = [10, 20]
#creates a list
b = a
b += [30, 40]
print("a =",a)
print("b =" ,b)
#becuase a is a list, not a number,b is simply adding to the list, and not adding to each individual number within that list
#What is the output of the following code and what arithmetic operators is being used here?
print(2%6)
#The output prints a 2 and diregards the 6, the percentage symbol acts as a comment within the print function
#What is the output of the following code and what arithmetic operators are used here?
print(2 * 3 ** 3 * 4)
#The output is 216. The double asterisk is an exponential operator whereas a single asterisk is multiplication
#What is a text editor?
##Ans: A text editor is the space given where the user can input their code for any given coding language, whether it be python, C-code, or html
#What is python?
##Ans: Python is a programming language who's main focus is to establish codes that are easy to read and edit for data analysis and software and wesbite development
#What is jupyter notebook, what type of python environment is it, and what alternatives are there to jupyter notebook?
##Ans: Jupyter notebook is a web-based interactibve computer programming platform. It allows users to collaborate on code and run code via web-browser
